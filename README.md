# Multiplicative noise infusion
# 
First proposed by [Evans, Zayatz and Slanta (1998)](http://www.jos.nu/Articles/abstract.asp?article=144537), multiplicative input noise infusion (henceforth simply "noise infusion") is used as a disclosure-avoidance measure. See also [our implementation](https://ideas.repec.org/h/nbr/nberch/0485.html) in the [Quarterly Workforce Indicators](http://lehd.ces.census.gov/data) (published in 2009, but first implemented in 2003).

This repository illustrates noise infusion with some toy data.
